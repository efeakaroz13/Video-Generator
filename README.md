# Anton V1.2
 
This project is helping us to make videos with limitless internet content. It is generating videos from the articles you give! It reads the article in the video. For making a more colorful video Anton is adding image slides about the topic!
## Little issues
If you can't run the program be sure that all modules are installed. If it is not working after installing these modules just edit security.py(it is encrypting the python files when you run the same app on another computer) remove mac address check at the try block like this:
```
self.macaddress = ""
```
### FFMPEG
If you are on mac or linux you can download and install FFMPEG with command line using ```apt-get```,```brew```,```macports```.

## Supported websites
There is 5 supported websites on Anton but we will make more support at the future. Also for developer I commented the parts of video generation you can make your own support in a few minutes.
